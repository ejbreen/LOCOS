# .constraintmatrix explained
# 
#

# This program first builds the seperate components of the constraint matrix then combines them
# Each part must follow the same structure and have similar elements.
# The elemets that are common to each part are:
# 	row_ind_n:	When reducing constraint to 1D, this is the row index of each element
# 	col_ind_n:	
# 	ones_n:			
# 	***_vals_n: 


# The parts are as follows:
# 	Part 1:
# 	Part 2:
# 	Part 3:
# 	part 4:
# 	Part 5:
# 	Part 6:
# 	Part 7:
# 	Part 8:
# 	Part 9: 
# 	Part 10:
# 	Part 11:
# 	Part 12:
