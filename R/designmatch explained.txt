designmatch explained

The most important funciton within designmatch is "bmatch"
  This is the function for matching between 2 sets (treatment and control)
    This is in contrast to nmatch which doesn't have a treatment indicator
  Most of the rest of the functions are there to enable bmatch

Before starting, make sure the data is all within one dataframe
  There should be one column that is a treatment indicator
    This column can only take values 0 and 1

bmatch has several peramaters that adjust it's functionality
  t_ind
    a vector indicating treatment 
    can only take 0's and 1's 
      1 indicates treatment
    should be taken directly from combined dataframe
  MATCHING TYPE PARAMATERS
    dist_mat
      a matrix of distances between ever treatment and control unit
        treatmet indexs are the rows and control units are the columns
      this can be created by tossing the treatment indicator and a matrix of covariates into the 
          "distmat" function
      dist_mat has some interesting interactions with the subset_weight paramater
    subset_weight
      "regulates the trade-off between the total sum of distances between matched pairs and the 
          total number of matched pairs"
      this is just a scalar number
      the larger the subser_weight, the more the algorythm will preference the total number of 
          matched pairs vs the total sum of differences between the pairs
      honestly, I'm not enitrely sure what this does
      now on to the weird interactions
        if subset_weight is NULL, bmatch will try to match all treated observations
        if subset_weight is 1 and dist_mat = NULL then bmatch will solve a cardinality 
            matching problem
  GRAPH SHAPE PARAMATERS
    n_controls
      a scalar which indicates the number of controls to be matched to each treated unit
      n_controls = 1 is pair matching
        n_controls = 3 would be 3:1 matching
    total_groups
      the total number of matched pairs
      this one is still a little weird to me
      I do know that this cannot be larger than the number of treated units
