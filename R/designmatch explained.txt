designmatch explained

The most important funciton within designmatch is "bmatch"
  This is the function for matching between 2 sets (treatment and control)
    This is in contrast to nmatch which doesn't have a treatment indicator
  Most of the rest of the functions are there to enable bmatch

Before starting, make sure the data is all within one dataframe
  There should be one column that is a treatment indicator
    This column can only take values 0 and 1

There are several parameters to bmatch which allow it to be used for many different purposes
